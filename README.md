# Deep Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains source code and material produced for the exam of the course Deep Learning, attended in the second semester of the academic year 2022-2023 of master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Turin.

The course is teached by prof. Osella.

As part of the exam I discuss the Transformer model, implementing the code from paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) with the help of the related [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts) by Umar Jamil and other sources.

## Environment

Python 3.10 is used for the code base.

### Repostory structure

Source code is stored and described in file `transformer.ipynb`.

### Create usable Python module

A Python module can be extracted from notebook `transformer.ipynb` through utilities like [nbformat](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Cells containing source code and comments are identified with tag `convert-module`.
